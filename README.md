# Speed Changer

Speed changer is a browser extension that allows you to change the speed of a youtube video.

## Pff, Youtube already have that option you genius!

Yeah, that rigth. But youtube only let's you choose between a finite number of speed options. I use *Speed Changer* to practice songs on youtube and for that purpose I need a fine-grained control over the speed even. I can play master of puppets at 0.75x speed but not at 1x so I need something in the middle like 0.95x can Youtube give you that out-of-the-box?

## Ok, you're right but I use Firefox. This will work on it?

Suuure! I've got you covered. *Speed Changer* is actually a [Browser extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) that uses the WebExtension API so it is compatible with every browser that support this standard.

## Cool, do you have something else?

Of course! Being able to change the speed is not enough so what about saving your speed preferences for every song? so every time you are trying to nail the tornado of souls' solo (You wish!) you don't have to set the speed at 0.3x speed.
